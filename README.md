## Introduction

Welcome to Programming as Conversation, Part 2! In this module, we'll be
enriching the kinds of conversations we have with Ruby. In Part 1, we learned to
recognize _expressions_ and saw that the data and operations they are comprised of 
are _evaluated_ to produce a result or "return value." We also learned three 
important expressions: the constant expression, the assignment expression, and the 
variable lookup expression. In this next module, we'll see that evaluations of 
expressions, while powerful, need _statements_ to control when (sequence), whether 
(selection), and how many times (repetition) they are _evaluated_. Code of this 
type is called a "statement."

We can see a parallel between expressions and statements to how children
_first_ learn to speak and how they enrich their communication with time.
Learning to talk is a gigantic achievement. It's a much-loved moment for
parents when a child learns to communicate through words instead of screaming
fits. In this early phase, however, some of their statements lack politeness
and sensitivity.

Part of growing in their ability to converse is learning to wrap their desires
in politeness and consideration for the listener. "Would you mind giving me a
cookie?" and "Would you care to join me for a cookie?" both express the same
desire as our "rougher" example above, but show maturity.

The same is true in code: we can do a great amount of work using just
_expressions_. However, _mature_ "speakers" of code learn to wrap their
_expressions_ in other _decisions_ and _context_. This ensures not only
that the right thing happens ***but also*** that others can understand the
code easily. Learning to "wrap" expressions in reader-friendly context will
continue into Programming as Conversation Part 3 as well.

Let's start learning how to wrap our _expressions_ in _statements_ that will
give us greater flexibility **and** enrich our communication.

## Define a Statement Versus an Expression

**Statements alter the order in which code is evaluated from the default
execution order of top-to-bottom, left-to-right. The default execution order is
sometimes called the default code "flow." Statements usually return no value.**

Below, `1 + 1` is an expression:

```ruby
result = 1 + 1 #=> 2`
```

Below, `puts result` is a ***statement***:

```ruby
result = 1 + 1 #=> 2`
puts result #=> nil`
2
```

Here's an important distinction. The return value, after the `#=>` is `nil` but
a "side-effect" of running the `puts` statement is printing `2` to the screen.
Expressions ***always*** return a value. Statements do not, as we see with `puts`.

## Identify the `nil` Value and Its Purpose

The `nil` value means "no value." You might recall that it is treated as a 
`falsey` value in Ruby. This makes sense because it's the value that represents
"nothing."

It's not `3` and it's also not any other number. It's also not `0`, a value
that's no distance from `0` on the number scale. It's a world without the scale
of `Integer`s or `Float`s.

In short, `nil` is The Void.

The return value of `puts` (print something to something) is `nil` because
Ruby can't know whether the printing was successful. It knows whether adding
`1` to `1` was successful. But what if the monitor is disconnected? What if no
one is looking at it? Because Ruby can't know, it says `nil`.

Again, this behavior underscores the difference between _expressions_ and
_statements_: _expressions_ always return values. Statements might, but they
might not.

## Identify Three Core Categories of Code Statements

There are three types of statement that change the order of what gets run and
in what order:

* **Sequence**: What code will run next by default?
* **Selection**: Given the default order (or "sequence"), can we choose to run
  certain lines of code and not others? How do we do so?
* **Repetition**: Given the default order (or "sequence"), can we choose to do
  something until a condition is met or until code has run some number of
  times?


> **NOTE**: Be sure to try the following examples yourself in IRB.  These
> examples assume you're working in a fresh, new IRB session _for each
> example_. Specifically, they assume that the variables they use have not yet 
> been defined. If you _don't_ restart IRB between each example, you might get 
> a surprising result. If that happens, just use `exit` to leave IRB and then 
> launch a fresh session.

## Provide An Example of Sequence Statement

![Sequence Image](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-univbasics-2/sequence-and-comments/Sequence_thick.png)

_As you'll see in the next lessons, we've created a little icon for each of
these types of statements. We're going to introduce you to these icons now so that we
remind you which type of statement you're looking at._

The sequence statement isn't so much a statement, as an assumption. Ruby by
default will read our code according to the rules of a **default sequence** or
**default flow**: "every line, top to bottom, left to right as ruled by order
of operations." The "icon" above shows that rule. When you see it, you should
immediately think about "execution order."

```ruby
result = 1 + 1
puts result #=> 2
```

You probably have an intuitive model of the **default sequence** since you
have the general mindset that English text is read "top to bottom, left to
right" and expect that to apply to code. It does! Isn't it nice when things
meet our default assumptions?

This is why you intuitively grasp why Ruby would throw an error with the
following code:

```ruby
puts result #=> Error
result = 1 + 1
```

This error makes sense because this code is trying to do a variable lookup
_before_ setting the variable that is looked up.

## Provide An Example of Selection Statement

![Seelection Image](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-univbasics-2/sequence-and-comments/Selection_thick.png)

Sometimes we need to deviate from the default **sequence**. We might need to
**select** a different path. There's a poem by Robert Frost about it:

> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
> And sorry I could not travel both 
> And be one traveler, long I stood 

In this case, the traveler is Ruby, traveling fatefully down the default
sequence. We, as programmers, create a fork, a "split" in fate, and ask Ruby to
take one path (or the other, or a third, or a fourth...and so on) based on a
Boolean "test" expression's return value. We ask Ruby to _select_ the path.

The first tool we'll learn to do **selection** is `if`. The `if` statement
disrupts the "default sequence" by asking Ruby to run a test, decide whether to
follow the path, and then move back to the default sequence.

```ruby
favorite_number = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
if favorite_number >= 10 # evaluating favorite_number >= 10 returns true
  favorite_number = favorite_number + 10
  puts "And now your favorite_number is 10 more!"
end
puts "THE END"
```

**Selection** lets us disrupt default flow by _making a choice_. If `favorite_number`
were assigned `0` at the time the `if` statement is evaluated, it would skip over
the code in the `if...end` block. That's why our icon shows the default
flow "hopping" from one point to another, skipping what's in the middle.

## Provide An Example of Repetition Statement

![Repetition Graphic](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/programming-univbasics-2/sequence-and-comments/Repetition_thick.png)

**Repetition** lets us disrupt default flow by _repeating_. The `.times`
method, which we will introduce formally in a few lessons, means "do something
`<value>` times." That "something" is held inside a `do...end` block. Other
programming languages like JavaScript like to use curly braces (`{}`) to set up
a "block of stuff to do". Ruby prefers `do...end`.

```ruby
favorite_number = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
10.times do
  favorite_number = favorite_number + 1
end
puts "And now your favorite_number is 10 more! It is #{favorite_number}"
```

**Repetition** lets us disrupt default flow by marking off a set of commands that
should be re-evaluated multiple times before resuming default flow. It's even
possible to get into a repetition statement that you never exit. Programmers
call that an "infinite loop." Most of the time, that's not a desirable situation.
Our icon shows the more desirable situation of us following default sequence, then
finding a block that we repeat multiple times, then returning to default sequence.

## Conclusion

This concludes our introduction to this module. This module is like a writing
class: we know how to write basic _sentences_ with a simple subject and a
simple verb. We're now going to try to write complete sentences with
conjunctions and punctuation (like the cookie examples!). We improve our basic
sentences by using SELECTION or REPETITION statements that allow us to create
code that deviates from the default "flow" or SEQUENCE.

In upcoming lessons, you'll see our icons repeated to help you have a visual
reminder of whether the statement you're learning is about SELECTION, REPETITION,
or SEQUENCE.
